This is a set of codes developed by Haining Wang for post process of channel turbulence. Including functions of:

	Calculating spatial statistics;

	Calculating space-time energy spectra and correlations;

	Solving Poisson equation for pressure;

	Generating .dat files readable by Tecplot;

	Ploting from .dat files.
